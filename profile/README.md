# Make People Social Again

Society is becoming increasingly atomized and devoid of human relationships. Never before have people been so technologically connected and yet so socially isolated. 

Relationships are weakening, communities are disappearing, and their place is being taken by substitutes: algorithms, para-relationships, and simulated intimacy. 

**This is not a crisis of individuals. It is a social crisis.**

If we do not change anything, these changes will only continue in this direction.
